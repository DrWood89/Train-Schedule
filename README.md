The challenges faced during this app was while utilizing moment to have app update in real time which i fixed 
and to delete data in the database when delete on the site.

### 4-Issues

When deleting a train from the schedule because i have it update every second the data comes back which means
it doesn't delete from the database.

---
### 5-Future Updates

In the future i would like to get my remove or delete function that move that date to a deleted table for future use
just in case we would like to re integrate that train back in the schedule.
